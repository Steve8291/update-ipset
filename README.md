# update-ipset
A script and config file that downloads ip lists, compares, sorts, and finally updates your ipsets

The initial idea for this came from the excellent script https://github.com/trick77/ipset-blacklist
It also relies heavily on iprange https://github.com/firehol/iprange
I would encourage you to check out these great tools as well.
