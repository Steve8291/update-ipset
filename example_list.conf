# If you this ipset is going to be a whitelist you may want to set AUTO_PROTECT=no
# Setting AUTO_PROTECT=yes will remove any of the below addresses from your list:

	# 172.16.0.0/12 (class B private lan)

############################## MATCH LIST ##############################################
# Include any files or URLs you would like to compare to this ipset.
# Addresses that have survived the whitelist will go on to be compared to those entered below.
# Any ip address not matching one from the match list will be removed from the set.
# This feature can be used to reduce your ipset so that only addresses from one country remain.
# This can be useful if you are already blocking certain countries in iptables.
# WARNING: be very careful with this. Entering a small ip list here could cause your resulting ipset to be blank if it doesn't match any of those ip's.
# Example: Adding the US zone ipblocks will delete all addresses in set that are not US.
